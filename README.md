# Crowdd-City-Demo-Unity
A simple simulation game
Differences from Crowd-City:
- Make a point of Main Caracter's of Teams. The most important thing to capture team is capturing the main caracter first.
(I couldn't edit my algorithm to wait until the last leaf caracter dies to capture a main character and a team. Anybody can find a solution about that, can contact me about that)
- There is no second move criterion for User Main Character.(It means you can not changing the face direction, just body move)
Some scripts are not used
